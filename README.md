# Deep-Learning-for-Brand-Logo-Detection

I downloaded the Flickr27-dataset, containing 270 images of 27 different brands and tried Keras frameowrk in R for brand detection.
There are at least two points to remember; the dataset is really small -especially to train a deep neural network, and some brands are hard to recognize, even for the human eye. In order to use the data for the Keras infrastructure, I created a small script to pre-process the image files.
